I think skia assumes that the upper left pixel is a rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)` so it has the center in `(0.5, 0.5)`. This seems good for GUI where `(0, 0)` might represent the phisical corner, however in some image processing algorithms I assumed the first pixel is centered in `(0, 0)`.\r\nWhich is the best way to go?",
      "response": "The choice of coordinate system depends on the specific use case of your crate. If you are building a GUI application, then it might make sense to use the coordinate system where the upper left pixel is a rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)` with the center in `(0.5, 0.5)`. However, if you are building an image processing library, then it might make more sense to use the coordinate system where the first pixel is centered in `(0, 0)`.\n\nIn any case, it's important to be consistent with the coordinate system you choose throughout your crate. If you need to convert between coordinate systems, you can define conversion functions that take in a point in one coordinate system and return the corresponding point in the other coordinate system.\n\nFor example, if you decide to use the coordinate system where the upper left pixel is a rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)` with the center in `(0.5, 0.5)`, you can define a function to convert a point from the image processing coordinate system to the GUI coordinate system like this:\n\n```rust\nfn to_gui_coords(point: Vector2<f64>, image_size: Vector2<f64>) -> Vector2<f64> {\n    let x = point.x / image_size.x;\n    let y = point.y / image_size.y;\n    Vector2::new(x, 1.0 - y)\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes in a point in the image processing coordinate system and the size of the image, and returns the corresponding point in the GUI coordinate system. You can define a similar function to convert a point from the GUI coordinate system to the image processing coordinate system.",
