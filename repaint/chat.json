You can define a trait for each functionality that you want to provide, such as blending modes, antialiasing, transformations, and drawing methods. Once you have defined these traits, you can implement them for each of the libraries that you want to use as a backend. This will allow you to switch between backends without changing the code that uses your painting library.\n\nHere's an example of how you could define a trait for blending modes:\n\n```rust\npub trait BlendMode {\n    fn set_blend_mode(&mut self, blend_mode: BlendModeType);\n}\n\npub enum BlendModeType {\n    Normal,\n    Multiply,\n    Screen,\n    Overlay,\n    Darken,\n    Lighten,\n    ColorDodge,\n    ColorBurn,\n    HardLight,\n    SoftLight,\n    Difference,\n    Exclusion,\n    Hue,\n    Saturation,\n    Color,\n    Luminosity,\n}\n```\n\nYou can then implement this trait for each of the backends that you want to use.",
